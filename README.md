# tedxabq-2015
This is the repo for the complete redesign of the http://tedxabq.com/ website.  

You can see the current sandbox Business Catalyst website here: [http://tedxabq.businesscatalyst.com](http://tedxabq.businesscatalyst.com)

## The Primary Goal
*We want to give TEDxABQ a beautiful, functional website that corrals all data into one spot, is easy to use, and useful for fans as well as for TEDxABQ volunteers.*  

### Our Stack
+ **Languages**: HTML, CSS (SCSS), JS, [BC.Next](http://docs.businesscatalyst.com/dev-assets/reference), [Liquid](http://docs.businesscatalyst.com/dev-assets/reference#!/code-snippets/liquid/index.html)
+ **CSS Library**: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
+ **CSS PreProcessor**: [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
+ **JavaScript Library**: [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)
+ **Platform**: [Business Catalyst](http://businesscatalyst.com)

### Features of the Platform
Because we are using [**Business Catalyst**](http://businesscatalyst.com) as our platform, we have a few cool features that will be immediately, completely integrated into the website design.  Among them:
+ An Event Calendar
+ A robust, secure E-Commerce system
+ Wide array of supported payment gateways
+ A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system
+ Integration with Facebook and Twitter
+ A Content Management System (CMS)
+ A way to build custom apps without too much coding (if any)
+ WYSIWYG Form Builder
+ Blog(s)
+ Password-protected user-only areas (for volunteers, fans of TEDxABQ, and Speakers, etc)
+ A robust email marketing system
+ Reporting and Data Analytics
